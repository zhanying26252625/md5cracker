Requirements & building
=======================

Make sure you have the CUDA SDK installed and compiled in ~/NVIDIA_CUDA_SDK.
This code uses the cutil library from the SDK.

Then do:

	make

Quick Start
===========

Want to see how fast your system is? Do:

	make benchmark

and wait a few seconds to minutes.

Usage
=====

Usage #1:

	cat wordlist.txt | ./cuda_md5

will compare the CPU vs. GPU code by loading the list of words from stdin,
computing the MD5 hashes on GPU and CPU, and printing out the timing
results.

Usage #2:

	./cuda_md5 --queryDevice

gives the information about your GPU (taken from deviceQuery SDS example).

Usage #3:

	cat wordlist.txt | ./cuda_md5 --search="WhateverWord"

will match the hash of WhateverWord to hashes of words loaded from the
dictionary. Both the computation of dictionary-word hashes and their
comparison on with the target is done on the GPU.

Usage #4:

	cat wordlist.txt | ./cuda_md5 --search="WhateverWord" --benchmark
	or
	cat wordlist.txt | ./cuda_md5 --benchmark

will go through all possible threads-per-block values to find the optimal
number, and print the results on the screen. To convert the output to a
tab-separated format suitable for plotting, pipe the output of this command
to something like:

	| sed -r 's/ *[^ ]+=/\t/g' > bench.dat


Benchmarks and Visualization
============================

Look at SuperMongo macro file macros.sm in bench/ subdirectory. Unless
you're an astronomer using SuperMongo, it's doubtfull these will be of much
use to you but may be a good starting point for e.g., using gnuplot to make
similar plots.

Some plots, derived from benchmarks of my machines, are already there in
bench/figs and bench/data directories.
